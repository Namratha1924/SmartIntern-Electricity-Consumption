# 🔌 Plugging Into The Future: Electricity Consumption Patterns (Tableau Project)

This project analyzes electricity consumption trends using a simulated dataset. Built as part of the **SmartIntern** program, it uses Tableau for data visualization and Python for data generation.

## 📁 Project Files

- `electricity_consumption_dataset.csv`: Raw simulated data  
- `electricity_consumption_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned data with peak hour and time categories  
- `region_avg_consumption.png`: Region-wise average consumption chart  
- `user_type_pie.png`: User type-based consumption pie chart  
- `time_category_consumption.png`: Time category vs average consumption  
- `peak_vs_nonpeak.png`: Peak hour vs non-peak hour average usage  
- `SmartIntern_Project_Report_.pdf`: Final project report 

## 🧠 Insights

- Evening hours show peak usage (6–10 PM)  
- Industrial users consume the most energy  
- South Zone reports the highest average consumption  

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Tableau Public  
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- Excel
